Here I record some command that would be useful in further migrations:
    1. python manage.py makemigrations (for detecting migrations you have made)
    2. python manage.py migrate (for finishing migration)
    3. python manage.py migrate -fake (do fake migrations, quite useful when some table already existed in database)
